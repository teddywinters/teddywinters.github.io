Hello citizens of the interwebs! My name is Christiana and I am currently a high school student from California. This past summer (2017), I started working on an independent research project about the history of the legal system in California with an emphasis on the California prison system during the Gold Rush. I hope this webpage is informative and educational. I have spent many hours contacting professionals and spending time at research libraries so all information should be as accurate as possible.
<br><br> If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me at christianawong1(at)gmail(dot)com. Happy browsing!
