What caused the influx of crime during this time?
</h3>
<p>
The Gold Rush was a major pull factor in regards to immigration. Thousands of people both in the United States and in the world traveled to California in the hope of striking gold.
<br/>
Another issue with worldwide immigration in regards to crime rates is that it creates herterogeneous societies. Because of this urbanization and change in population demographics, there was the rise of predatory crime along side the steady amount of violent crime present in all sophisticated societies.
